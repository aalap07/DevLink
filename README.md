# DevLink
Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy social web app to 'link developers together'. Users can post their side projects and request to join those of others. Deployed to AWS on a Ubuntu EC2 instance.
I always found it difficult to find short term side projects whenever I wasn't attending a hackathon, so I sought
to create something simple and effective while learning new technologies.
